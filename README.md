# Flight-Price-Prediction

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build Machine Learning model that can assist airlines to keep their rates. 

### Methods Used
* Data Preprocessing
* Data Cleaning
* Feature Engineering
* Machine Learning
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, jupyter
* Numpy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Datetime
* One Hot Encoding
* Label Encoding
* Hyper-parameter Tuning
* RandomizedSearchCV
* etc. 

## Project Description
This project is about Predicting Flight Prices using Regression techniques to find Mean Absolute Error, Mean squared Error, Root mean Squared Error and r2 score. I have used Extra tree regressor for Feature Selection and Random Forest regressor to fit the model and do predictions. Data source is Kaggle Dataset 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nikhilmittal/flight-fare-prediction-mh.
In this project, Data Preprocessing and data cleaning is a major challenge. The visualization plots helped in checking assumptions for Regression Technique.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [https://github.com/sayali-bot/Flight-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Data_Train.xlsx] ([https://github.com/sayali-bot/Flight-Price-Prediction]) within this repo.
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [https://github.com/sayali-bot/Flight-Price-Prediction/blob/main/Flight%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb] 4. etc...
